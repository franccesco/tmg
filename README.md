# Tmg

A CLI built in Ruby to track your gems stats on RubyGems.org. This is mostly a personal project to keep track of my gems and also to checkout the latest version information of another gem. I grew tired of going to the rubygems.org website or the github repo of a project to check what's the latest version of a gem to add it to my project.

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tmg

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
