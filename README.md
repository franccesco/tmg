# Tmg

A CLI built in Ruby to track your gems stats on RubyGems.org. This is mostly a personal project to keep track of my gems and also to checkout the latest version information of another gem. I grew tired of going to the rubygems.org website or the github repo of a project to check what's the latest version of a gem to add it to my project.
